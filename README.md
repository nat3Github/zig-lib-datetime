Exposes a `DateTime` structure that can be initialized and acted upon using various methods. All public methods return a new structure.

Does not currently support time zones outside of UTC.

Does not handle leap seconds.

See the `FormatSeq` structure for display information on what to pass as a `fmt` string.
